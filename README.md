# Insurance Cost Prediction

This project uses a dataset of insurance policy holders to build a regression model that predicts medical expenses based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, and number of children.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs and explore relationships between features and expenses using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- Features:
  - `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `expenses`

## ðŸ§ª Steps

1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Used histograms, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps.
2. **Preprocessing** â€“ One-hot encoding, log transformations.
3. **Modeling** â€“ Linear Regression, Ridge Regression.
4. **Evaluation** â€“ RMSE, RÂ², residual diagnostics.
5. **Interpretation** â€“ Visualized coefficients and predictions.

## Learnings

- Feature scaling and encoding impact model performance.
- Log transformation helped in stabilizing variance.
- Smoking status is a dominant factor in cost prediction.
